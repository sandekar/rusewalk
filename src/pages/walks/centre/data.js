Because the house of the Minister of Justice was located on the same site, the construction was delayed. This is how and why the first courthouse in Bulgaria that was finished came to be the one in Sofia.  <br /><br /> The construction of the Ruse courthouse began in 1929 and ended in 1939. Its opening was celebrated on January 28, 1940. The interior of the building was designed entirely by arch. Papazov, and the stained glass - by Prof. Ivan Penkov. The interior is rich with its marble columns and a granite floor,  beautiful curved two-armed staircase and colorful ornamental windows.  <br /><br /> The sculptural figures on the facade of the building were designed and executed by Prof. Lyubomir Dalchev in 1938.  <br /><br /> During the Socialist regime, the building served as District and City Council.  <br /><br />"

During the communist period, many priests were arrested and the Church's social and educational activities were banned. Many of its properties were confiscated. In 1950 the Church hall was nationalized and rebuilt for the functions of the Opera house. Today, only a fence separates the Opera house and the oldest church in Ruse – \"St. Trinity\".  The premiere of the first performance of the newly established Ruse Opera was La Traviata by Verdi on 27.11.1979 under the direction of maestro Konstantin Iliev.  "

It was built in 1898–1902 to accommodate the local theatre performances. The name originates from the construction's purpose: to provide the school board of trustees with funds by means of the theatre hall, library, casino and shop rents. Today, Dohodno Zdanie is a cultural monument and one of the symbols of Rousse. <br /><br /> An authoritative jury discussed 15 projects that participated in a contest for the construction of the building, and chose the Voilà une idée project by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria\" target=\"_blank\">Austrian</a> architect <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Paul_Brang\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Paul Brang</a>. <br /><br /> The construction of the building met severe financial problems due to the increase of the initial costs of 350,000 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_lev\" target=\"_blank\">leva</a>, the school board of trustees was forced to borrow an initial 200,000 and then a further 50,000 from the Stremlenie company, mortgaging its own property, and then conclude another loan agreement with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girdap\" target=\"_blank\">Girdap</a> Bank for 600,000 leva. The municipality mortgaged its cattle butchering receipts and the school board of trustees— its shops and Dohodno Zdanie itself. <br /><br /> The building was deemed finished in 1900, but the theatre hall was incomplete. The first theatre performance took place in the casino hall in 1901, until the scene and theatre hall were ultimately completed in 1902. <br /><br /> The scene was expanded in 1921, and an additional storey of it was built in 1924. It was considerably repaired in 1933–1934. The restoration of the entire building began in 1975 and lasted until 15 December 2006. <br /><br /> The most admirable part are the seven figures located on its roof - each of them bearing a certain symbolism (art, science, agriculture, crafts, trade, defense and the free spirit). The Central figure is the winged Mercury - the Roman god of trade and profit, symbolizing the goals and expectations for this building. <br/> <br/> <img src=\"http://www.ruseonline.info/smf/otoaeto/t93/?action=dlattach;attach=4311;image\" >"
